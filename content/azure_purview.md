## Explain the process for registering and scanning a new data source in Azure Purview.
To register and scan a new data source in Azure Purview:

1. **Register the data source**:  
   - In the Purview Studio, navigate to the “Data Map” section.
   - Select “Register” and choose the desired data source type (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Blob Storage, etc.).
   - Provide details such as name, description, subscription, resource group, and resource identifier for the new data source.
   - Complete the registration process, making the data source available for scanning.

2. **Create a scan**:  
   - Go to the registered data source in the Data Map.
   - Click “New Scan.”
   - Configure the scan by specifying parameters:
     - Define scan scope (select databases, containers, folders, or schemas to include/exclude).
     - Choose or create a scan rule set to specify what metadata, classifications, and sensitivity labels to extract.
     - Set up authentication credentials. This can involve creating and assigning a Managed Identity or using stored credentials within Azure Purview.
   - Configure scan triggers (run on demand or schedule recurring scans).

3. **Run and monitor the scan**:  
   - Start the scan manually or wait for the scheduled trigger.
   - Monitor the scan status and progress through the Purview Studio interface.
   - After completion, review scan results, which include discovered assets, schema, lineage, and classification insights.

4. **Review and manage cataloged data**:  
   - Post-scan, assets and metadata are available in the Data Catalog.
   - Data stewards and users can now browse, search, and manage metadata, lineage, and classifications.

This process ensures Purview’s Data Map is populated with up-to-date insights and governance information about enterprise data assets.

## What types of data sources can be connected and scanned by Azure Purview?
Azure Purview can connect to and scan a broad range of data sources across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments. Supported data sources include:

- **Azure Data Services:** Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse), Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for MySQL, Cosmos DB, and others.
- **On-premises Databases:** SQL Server (via self-hosted integration runtime), Oracle, Teradata, SAP (SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA using ODP), and others using self-hosted integration runtime.
- **Non-Azure Cloud Data Sources:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, and others (preview/GA features may vary).
- **SaaS Applications:** Power BI, Microsoft 365, Salesforce (via connectors), and others.
- **File Systems:** File shares on-premises and in the cloud.
- **Big Data:** Hadoop, Hive Metastore, and more through supported connectors or integration runtimes.

Purview constantly expands supported connectors, so checking current documentation is recommended for the latest list. It can discover, classify, and scan both structured and unstructured data assets across these sources.

## How does Azure Purview help with data discovery and cataloging in a large organization?
Azure Purview automates the process of data discovery and cataloging across an organization by scanning data sources—both on-premises and in the cloud—to collect metadata and classify information. It creates a unified data map that provides a holistic view of all enterprise data assets, including databases, files, Power BI datasets, and SaaS sources.

Purview applies built-in and custom classification rules to automatically identify sensitive data (like PII, financial data), tags it appropriately, and maintains lineage information. This makes it easier for users to search, browse, and understand data assets, reducing time spent on manual discovery. The catalog provides business context, ownership, and usage details, enabling data consumers to confidently find and use trustworthy data for analytics, governance, and compliance. By centralizing metadata and lineage information, Azure Purview ensures data cataloging is consistent and scalable across the organization.

## Describe the process of automatic data classification in Azure Purview.
Automatic data classification in Azure Purview operates by scanning registered data sources and applying built-in or custom classification rules to the discovered data assets. The process involves several stages:

1. **Source Registration**: Data sources such as Azure Data Lake, SQL databases, or on-premises databases are registered with Azure Purview.

2. **Scanning**: Purview uses scan rules to crawl the data sources and examine datasets, including files, tables, and columns.

3. **Classification Engine**: During scanning, the data classification engine uses a library of over 100 built-in classifiers. These include patterns for common sensitive data types (like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or email addresses) utilizing regular expressions, keyword matching, and contextual analysis.

4. **Detection and Labeling**: The engine inspects the content and metadata of data assets, and when a pattern matches, it tags that data element with the relevant classification (e.g., "Microsoft.PersonalData.EmailAddress"). Multiple classifications can be applied to one asset if multiple patterns are detected.

5. **Custom Classifiers**: Organizations can define custom classifiers if there is a need to detect proprietary or industry-specific data patterns by providing their own rules and pattern definitions.

6. **Review and Management**: After scanning, the results including applied classifications are available in the Purview Data Catalog. Data stewards and governance teams can review, manage, and search the discovered classifications.

7. **Continuous Updates**: Scans and classifications can be scheduled, allowing for ongoing automatic classification as data sources are updated or new data is added.

This automated approach enables organizations to quickly inventory and understand sensitive information spread across their data estate, supporting compliance, governance, and risk management initiatives.

## How does Azure Purview enable sensitive data identification and labeling?
Azure Purview enables sensitive data identification and labeling using automated data scanning, classification, and labeling features:

1. **Automated Scanning:**  
Purview connects to a wide range of data sources (Azure, on-premises, SaaS, and multi-cloud). It scans the metadata and content of data assets within these sources.

2. **Built-in Classifiers:**  
Purview provides a library of built-in sensitive information types (e.g., names, credit card numbers, government IDs). During scanning, these classifiers analyze and detect sensitive data patterns, such as PII and financial information.

3. **Custom Classifiers:**  
Organizations can define custom data classification rules using regular expressions or keywords to tailor detection to specific business needs.

4. **Label Assignment:**  
Purview integrates with Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) sensitivity labels. As sensitive information types are detected, Purview can recommend or automatically apply the appropriate sensitivity labels, ensuring that data handling policies follow regulatory and organizational requirements.

5. **Data Lineage and Mapping:**  
Identified and labeled sensitive data is mapped in the Purview Data Map, allowing users to track data lineage, discover where sensitive data resides, and understand its flow across the organization.

6. **Monitoring and Reporting:**  
Purview provides dashboards and reports that summarize the distribution and locations of sensitive data, enabling data stewards and compliance teams to maintain ongoing oversight.

Through these features, Azure Purview supports the identification, classification, and proactive labeling of sensitive data at scale across diverse data environments.

## Explain the concept of a glossary in Azure Purview and its benefits for data governance.
A glossary in Azure Purview is a collection of business terms and definitions that are used to standardize language across an organization. Each glossary term can include definitions, synonyms, acronyms, and links to related terms or associated data assets within the Purview Data Map.

The main benefits of using a glossary in Azure Purview for data governance include:

1. **Standardization of Terminology:** Ensures consistent language and definitions, reducing ambiguity when referring to business concepts, data assets, or processes.
2. **Improved Data Discovery:** Enables users to search for data assets using familiar business terms, even if the technical schema or naming conventions differ.
3. **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates communication between business users, data stewards, and technical teams by providing a shared vocabulary.
4. **Compliance and Auditability:** Helps demonstrate and enforce compliance by documenting and governing how terms are defined and used across the organization.
5. **Linking Business Context to Data Assets:** Connects business definitions directly to data assets in the catalog, improving context and trust in data usage.
6. **Impact Analysis:** Assists in understanding the downstream impact of changes to business terms on data assets and vice versa.

Overall, the glossary feature supports the broader data governance goals of stewardship, discoverability, and policy enforcement within Azure Purview.

## How do you manage business and technical metadata using Azure Purview?
Azure Purview enables the management of both business and technical metadata through a unified data catalog. Business metadata, such as glossary terms and classifications, can be defined and maintained in the Purview Data Catalog. Users can create glossary terms to represent business concepts and link those terms to data assets, ensuring a consistent business vocabulary across the organization.

Technical metadata is automatically harvested from registered data sources using built-in scanning and classification capabilities. Purview extracts detailed information about datasets, tables, columns, schemas, lineage, and sources during scans.

Users can enhance metadata by:
- Tagging assets with business glossary terms,
- Assigning classifications (e.g., Sensitive, PII),
- Adding custom metadata with user-defined key/value pairs.

The catalog supports rich search, filtering, and browsing experiences, enabling users to discover data using either business or technical context. Data stewards and data owners can manage metadata enrichment, governance, and curation directly through the Azure Purview portal. API access and integration options allow for further automation and integration with other governance or data management tools.

## What strategies would you use to keep the Azure Purview data catalog up to date as data sources evolve?
To keep the Azure Purview data catalog up to date as data sources evolve, I would use the following strategies:

1. **Automated and Scheduled Scans:**  
   Configure automated and recurring scans for all registered data sources. This ensures that any structural changes, additions, or deletions in data assets are detected and cataloged regularly without manual intervention.

2. **Incremental Scanning:**  
   Leverage Purview’s capability for incremental scans to only detect and update changes since the last scan, rather than scanning all assets each time, making the process efficient and timely.

3. **Change Notification Integration:**  
   Integrate with data source change notification mechanisms, such as Azure Event Grid or custom webhooks. This allows immediate triggers of catalog scans when significant changes like new datasets or schema modifications occur.

4. **Automated Data Source Onboarding:**  
   Implement automation (using ARM templates, PowerShell, or REST APIs) for registering new data sources to Purview as part of the provisioning workflows, ensuring new or migrated sources are promptly cataloged.

5. **Metadata Enrichment Workflows:**  
   Use Azure Data Factory or Logic Apps to detect when new or updated data assets are ingested, and automate metadata enrichment and pushing updates to Purview.

6. **Periodic Review and Governance Processes:**  
   Set up governance processes where owners or stewards periodically review the catalog for stale, orphaned, or redundant entries, especially after large migrations or deprecations.

7. **Monitoring and Alerting:**  
   Monitor scan logs, Purview system health, and catalog freshness metrics. Set alerts for scan failures or unusually outdated catalog entries to trigger remediation actions.

8. **APIs for Continuous Integration:**  
   Integrate Purview's REST APIs into CI/CD pipelines used for data platform development, ensuring catalog updates are synchronized with code and environment changes.

By combining automation, integration, and governance, this strategy minimizes manual effort, reduces data drift, and keeps the Purview catalog an accurate reflection of the evolving data landscape.

## Can you explain how lineage tracking works in Azure Purview and scenarios in which it proves valuable?
Lineage tracking in Azure Purview captures and visualizes how data moves, transforms, and is consumed across various data sources and services in an organization. It provides a graphical view showing data sources, transformations, intermediate datasets, and destinations, tracing data as it flows through ETL processes, data warehouses, Power BI reports, and other tools.

**How it works:**
- Azure Purview integrates with supported data systems—such as Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Power BI, SQL databases, and others.
- As data pipelines run or BI reports are refreshed, Purview automatically collects metadata about which datasets are read, transformed, or written at each step.
- This metadata is processed to construct end-to-end lineage diagrams, showing upstream and downstream relationships.

**Valuable scenarios:**
1. **Impact Analysis:** When schema changes are planned for a dataset, lineage helps identify all downstream systems, processes, and users potentially affected.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** If a data quality issue or report error is detected, lineage tracing enables rapid identification of the upstream source and transformation logic involved.
3. **Compliance and Auditing:** Regulatory frameworks often require traceability of data movement. Lineage provides proof of data handling and transformation for compliance.
4. **Data Discovery and Trust:** Users can assess origins and transformations of datasets, increasing transparency and trust in data for analytics or decision-making.
5. **Optimization:** Lineage can reveal redundant or obsolete data flows, helping optimize pipelines and reduce storage or compute costs.

Azure Purview’s lineage visualization can be both automated (from integrated data systems) and manually extended (using APIs or programmatic submission) for custom processing. This broadens coverage to include enterprise-specific data movement not captured out-of-the-box.

## How do you view, analyze, and troubleshoot data lineage mappings in Azure Purview?
To view, analyze, and troubleshoot data lineage mappings in Azure Purview:

1. **Accessing Lineage Views:**  
   - Navigate to the Purview Studio, and select your data map.
   - Use the search bar to locate the specific asset (table, file, dataset, etc.).
   - Open the asset details; the “Lineage” tab displays an interactive graphical representation of upstream and downstream processes, datasets, and activities involved in the data flow.

2. **Analyzing Lineage:**  
   - The graphical lineage viewer enables focus on end-to-end data movement across sources, transformations (like Data Factory/Dataflows, Synapse pipelines, Spark jobs), and sinks.
   - Expand nodes to analyze transformations, script details, or involved data processing components.
   - Leverage filtering to narrow lineage by operation type (copy, transformation), asset type, or specific sources/targets.
   - Hovering over connections or nodes provides summaries of activity, run information, and ownership (if configured).

3. **Troubleshooting Lineage Mappings:**  
   - Verify that scans and integration runtimes are up-to-date and configured for all sources involved.
   - Check that sources support automated lineage extraction (e.g., Data Factory, Synapse, SSIS). If not, verify if manual lineage can be registered via API.
   - Inspect pipeline run history in Azure Data Factory/Synapse for failed activity runs that could result in incomplete lineage.
   - In Purview, cross-check for missing lineage links, unexpected gaps, or assets identified as “Unclassified/Unknown.” These often indicate mapping or authentication issues.
   - Review scan status and error messages under the “Management Center” in Purview Studio for ingestion or connectivity errors.
   - Use activity logs and diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor for detailed error and warning traces when lineage isn’t appearing as expected.
   - Employ Purview REST APIs to validate and programmatically inspect lineage metadata or to patch incomplete lineage details.

By combining the visual tools in Purview Studio with scan/result logs and integration with source telemetry, efficient analysis and troubleshooting of data lineage is achievable.

## What are collections in Azure Purview and how do they help structure data assets?
Collections in Azure Purview are container-like entities that provide a hierarchical way to organize, manage, and secure data assets within the Purview Data Map. They enable organizations to logically structure data assets based on departments, business units, projects, or any organizational taxonomy.

By using collections:
- Data assets from different environments or domains can be grouped for easier discovery and management.
- Access control policies and permissions can be applied at the collection level, enabling data governance and separation of responsibilities.
- Delegated administration becomes possible, as collection administrators manage only the assets within their collections.
- Collections support the scaling of Purview across large organizations by segmenting the catalog and governance responsibilities.

For example, you might have top-level collections like “Finance,” “Sales,” and “Engineering,” each containing sub-collections for further granularity, such as “Finance/Accounting” or “Sales/EMEA.” Data sources, assets, and even further sub-collections can be registered within any collection, supporting flexible structuring that matches an organization’s data landscape.

## How would you manage access control and permissions within Azure Purview?
Access control and permissions in Azure Purview are managed using Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and collections. Here's how I would approach it:

1. **Define User Roles:** Assign built-in or custom Azure roles such as Purview Data Curator, Data Reader, or Data Source Administrator to users or security groups, according to the level of access they need within the Purview account or specific collections.

2. **Use Collections:** Organize assets and resources within Purview using collections. Assign permissions at the collection level to control which users or groups can access, curate, or manage assets within that collection.

3. **Assign Permissions:** Leverage RBAC assignments at the appropriate scope—either at the Purview account level or for specific collections. Assign only the minimum required privilege to follow the principle of least privilege.

4. **Utilize Managed Identities:** For automated and integration scenarios, use Azure managed identities to securely provide access to resource scanning and ingestion capabilities, thereby avoiding hardcoded credentials.

5. **Audit and Monitor:** Enable Purview activity logs and review access audits via Azure Monitor or Azure Activity Log to ensure compliance and to promptly detect unauthorized access.

6. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review access assignments and permissions to ensure that users only have access as required, and promptly revoke or adjust access when roles or organizational needs change.

This structured approach ensures that data governance, security, and compliance requirements are met within Azure Purview.

## Explain how Azure Purview supports compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.
Azure Purview supports compliance and regulatory reporting requirements through several core capabilities:

Overall, Purview’s end-to-end visibility, automated discovery, and metadata management provide the foundational controls required to manage the full lifecycle of data assets—from creation and active use through retention and eventual disposition.

## How do you handle schema evolution or versioning of assets in Azure Purview?
Azure Purview addresses schema evolution and versioning primarily through its integration with data sources and its lineage capabilities:

1. **Schema Scanning and Change Detection**: When Purview scans data sources (such as Azure Data Lake, SQL databases, or on-premises systems), it captures the current schema definitions of discovered assets. Repeated scans allow Purview to detect schema changes by comparing previously scanned metadata with new metadata.

2. **Lineage Visualization**: Through lineage tracking, Purview shows how data moves and transforms across sources, processes, and sinks. If a schema changes at any stage (for example, an added column in a table), this change is recorded at the asset level, and lineage graphs reflect these modifications.

3. **Schema Versioning**: While Purview does not natively support full-fledged schema versioning (like maintaining a complete version history of each asset’s schema), it does keep track of the latest scanned metadata. Users can use the scan history and metadata change logs to identify what changed and when.

4. **Change Alerts**: Purview provides activity and change logs where users can monitor updates, including schema changes. These logs and alerts help notify stakeholders of schema evolution events.

5. **Integration with Data Governance Processes**: Purview can be tightly integrated with data governance workflows. When changes are detected, governance teams can enforce policies or review and document the evolution as required.

6. **API and Automation**: For advanced versioning needs, the Purview REST API enables exporting asset metadata at each scan, allowing organizations to build custom schema history/versioning logic externally if needed.

In summary, while Azure Purview tracks and exposes schema changes across scans and surfaces these changes in lineage and asset metadata, native versioning support is basic. Custom versioning solutions can be implemented using APIs, but for now, monitoring and detection of schema evolution is Purview’s primary strength.

## What approaches do you follow to keep metadata in sync between Purview and operational systems?
To keep metadata in sync between Azure Purview and operational systems:

2. **Ownership and Stewardship**: Each asset can be assigned an owner and steward within the Purview catalog. This enables clear accountability for decisions regarding the asset’s end-of-life, including coordination with data owners before decommissioning.

3. **Data Lineage Tracking**: Purview maintains lineage information reflecting how data moves and transforms across systems. Before decommissioning, lineage views help assess the impact by identifying downstream dependencies, ensuring that removing a source does not break critical processes.

4. **End-of-Life Policies and Workflows**: Organizations can use Purview’s integration with Azure Policy, Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management, and automation tools to define and enforce data retention and end-of-life rules. These policies can trigger alerts, approvals, or automated actions like tagging assets as deprecated or scheduling removal.

5. **Asset Deprecation and Annotation**: Assets identified for decommissioning can be tagged or annotated as deprecated in Purview. This signals to users that the asset is being phased out, reducing accidental usage.

6. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Purview uses RBAC to limit who can modify, access, or delete cataloged assets, ensuring that decommissioning actions follow proper authorization paths.

7. **Reporting and Auditing**: Any decommissioning actions are logged for audit and compliance purposes, ensuring traceability of who performed what action and when.

While Purview catalogs and orchestrates these processes, actual data deletion or archiving occurs in the underlying data storage systems, often coordinated by automation or data lifecycle management tools, but tracked and reflected in Purview’s catalog.

## How have you handled customer or regulatory queries using Azure Purview’s catalog and lineage features?
I have addressed customer and regulatory queries using Azure Purview’s catalog and lineage features by leveraging the following capabilities:

**Data Catalog:**  
I use Purview’s catalog to quickly locate data assets that are relevant to a query, whether it’s from internal stakeholders or external auditors. The catalog provides metadata, classification, and ownership information, which helps me identify who manages the data and what sensitive information it contains. This metadata-centric view enables me to answer questions about where data resides, what data sets are available, and how data is classified, including details about regulatory tags like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.

**Data Lineage:**  
When queries require understanding of how data flows through different systems, I use Purview's lineage feature. It visually maps the journey of data from ingestion to storage, transformation, and reporting. This lineage tracking helps respond to regulatory requirements, such as demonstrating how personal data is processed or ensuring that proper controls are in place as data moves across environments. For example, if a regulator requests proof of data minimization, I extract the lineage reports showing the transformation steps where only necessary data attributes are selected or anonymized.

**Audit Trail and Reporting:**  
I generate and export lineage and catalog reports to document responses. This is useful for compliance audits or customer requests concerning data handling. The ability to show end-to-end data movement and processing, as well as content owners and stewards, provides transparency and builds trust with both internal and external parties.

**Automation and Policies:**  
For high-frequency regulatory queries, I leverage Purview’s automation capabilities via APIs to streamline the retrieval of catalog and lineage information. Additionally, data classification policies help to proactively tag sensitive data, making it easier to comply with data privacy requests such as subject access or erasure.

In summary, Azure Purview’s catalog allows me to quickly locate and document key metadata, while the lineage features enable traceability and transparency required for regulatory compliance and customer trust.

## How do you integrate Azure Information Protection with Azure Purview for enhanced data classification?
Azure Information Protection (AIP) integrates with Azure Purview to enrich data discovery and classification capabilities across your data estate. The integration works as follows:

1. **Unified Sensitivity Labels**: Azure Purview supports the same sensitivity labels that are defined and managed in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal (formerly Microsoft 365 Compliance Center, which includes AIP). This allows Purview to recognize, read, and apply AIP sensitivity labels during its data scanning and classification processes.

2. **Automatic Label Detection**: When Purview scans data sources, it detects and extracts existing AIP labels on files and database columns. These sensitivity labels are shown alongside scanned assets in the Purview data catalog.

3. **Label Application During Scans**: Purview can be configured to apply AIP/Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels automatically to newly discovered or classified data based on built-in or custom classification rules.

4. **Consistent Data Governance**: This integration ensures a unified approach to data governance and compliance, as classification rules and labels are consistent across both Microsoft 365 and Purview-managed data.

5. **End-to-End Visibility**: The applied AIP labels provide end-to-end visibility for sensitive data, enabling policies (such as encryption or access restrictions) to be consistently enforced, regardless of where the data resides.

To enable this integration:
- Ensure both Azure Purview and Azure Information Protection are set up in the tenant.
- Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to create and publish sensitivity labels.
- Link Azure Purview to the compliance portal by enabling label integration in Purview settings.
- Configure scans to recognize and apply sensitivity labels.

With this setup, Azure Purview leverages AIP sensitivity labels, providing enhanced data classification, discovery, and protection capabilities.

## What is your approach to documenting data engineering processes using Azure Purview?
My approach to documenting data engineering processes using Azure Purview is to leverage its data catalog and lineage capabilities to provide a unified and automated documentation mechanism. This involves the following steps:

1. **Registering Data Sources:** I begin by connecting all relevant data sources (Azure Data Lake, SQL databases, Power BI, etc.) to Purview so it can scan and extract metadata from each system.

2. **Automated Metadata Scanning:** I schedule regular scans in Purview to automatically discover, catalog, and update metadata for tables, views, files, and pipelines, ensuring that documentation always reflects the current state of data assets.

3. **Business Glossary Management:** I use Purview's business glossary feature to define and maintain standardized business terminology, ensuring consistent understanding and documentation across departments.

4. **Data Lineage Tracking:** I utilize Purview's lineage tracking to map end-to-end data flows—from ingestion through transformation to analytics—so users can see how data moves and transforms through each engineering process.

5. **Data Classification and Tagging:** I apply built-in or custom classification rules in Purview to tag sensitive or business-critical data, enhancing both documentation and compliance tracking.

6. **Annotations and Descriptions:** For each data asset, I add detailed custom descriptions, annotations, and related links (such as to design documentation or data dictionaries) directly in Purview, making process documentation easily accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

7. **Integration with Data Engineering Tools:** I integrate Purview with Azure Data Factory and Databricks pipelines. This captures pipeline metadata and enables automatic lineage documentation for data engineering processes.

8. **Review and Collaboration:** I implement processes for regular review and update of documentation within Purview, using its role-based access controls to allow subject matter experts to contribute to and validate the documentation.

By leveraging these Purview capabilities, I ensure that data engineering processes are comprehensively and consistently documented, discoverable, and auditable, supporting data governance and simplifying onboarding for new team members.
