## ### How to invoke Python interpreter?
You can invoke the Python interpreter in various ways, depending on your operating system and environment. Hereâ€™s a guide for different platforms:

1. From the command line (terminal)
Type `python3` (or just `python` if Python 3 is the default) and press Enter.
2. Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
3. Executing a Python Script
You can directly run a Python script by invoking the interpreter followed by the script name. For example:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
```
4. Interactive Mode in Python
You can also start Python in interactive mode to execute Python commands directly:
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): After invoking python or python3 from the command line, you'll be in an interactive environment where you can type Python code and see immediate results.

Example session:
```python
$ python3
Python 3.9.1 (default, Dec 11 2020, 06:28:49) 
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
>>> exit()
```
This starts the Python interpreter, allows you to execute commands, and then exit the interpreter.

## ### Passing arguments to scripts
1. Using `sys.argv`
- The `sys.argv` list contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. The first element (`sys.argv[0]`) is the script name, and the subsequent elements are the arguments.
```python
import sys

# Accessing command-line arguments
print("Script name:", sys.argv[0])
print("First argument:", sys.argv[1])
print("Second argument:", sys.argv[2])

# Run this as: python script.py arg1 arg2
```

2. Using argparse module
- The argparse module is more powerful and allows for better control over command-line arguments.
```python
import argparse

# Initialize the parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Process some integers.")

# Adding arguments
parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+', help='an integer for the accumulator')

parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const', const=sum, default=max, help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')

# Parsing arguments
args = parser.parse_args()

print(args.accumulate(args.integers))

# Run this as: python script.py 1 2 3 4 --sum
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Basic arithmetic operations
Python can be used as a powerful calculator directly in its interactive interpreter or by writing simple scripts.

You can perform basic arithmetic operations using Python operators:
```python
# Addition
result = 3 + 5
print(result)  # Outputs: 8

# Subtraction
result = 10 - 4
print(result)  # Outputs: 6

# Multiplication
result = 7 * 6
print(result)  # Outputs: 42

# Division
result = 8 / 2
print(result)  # Outputs: 4.0

# Floor Division (returns an integer)
result = 8 // 3
print(result)  # Outputs: 2

# Modulus (remainder of division)
result = 8 % 3
print(result)  # Outputs: 2

# Exponentiation (power)
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Using the `math` module
For more advanced mathematical functions, Python provides the `math` module:
```python
import math

# Square root
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Outputs: 4.0

# Trigonometric functions
result = math.sin(math.pi / 2)
print(result)  # Outputs: 1.0

result = math.cos(math.pi)
print(result)  # Outputs: -1.0

# Logarithms
result = math.log(100)  # Natural logarithm (base e)
print(result)  # Outputs: 4.605170185988092

result = math.log10(100)  # Logarithm base 10
print(result)  # Outputs: 2.0

# Factorial
result = math.factorial(5)
print(result)  # Outputs: 120
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Handling complex numbers
Python natively supports complex numbers:
```python
# Define a complex number
z = 2 + 3j

# Real part
real_part = z.real
print(real_part)  # Outputs: 2.0

# Imaginary part
imaginary_part = z.imag
print(imaginary_part)  # Outputs: 3.0

# Conjugate
conjugate = z.conjugate()
print(conjugate)  # Outputs: (2-3j)

# Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with complex numbers
z1 = 1 + 2j
z2 = 3 - 4j

result = z1 + z2
print(result)  # Outputs: (4-2j)

result = z1 * z2
print(result)  # Outputs: (11+2j)
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: `eval()` for quick calculations
You can use the `eval()` function to evaluate string expressions as Python code:
```python
expression = "3 * (2 + 7) - 8"
result = eval(expression)
print(result)  # Outputs: 19
```
Note: Be cautious when using eval() with untrusted input, as it can execute arbitrary code.

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Handling large numbers
Python handles arbitrarily large integers, so you can work with very large numbers without any special libraries:

```python
# Large number multiplication
large_num = 999999999999999999999999 * 888888888888888888888888

print(large_num)
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Floating-point precision
Python provides built-in floating-point precision, but for high-precision calculations, consider using the decimal module:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# High precision calculation
result = Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2')

print(result)  # Outputs: 0.3
```

## ### Using Python as a calculator: Built-in functions for common tasks
Python provides many built-in functions for mathematical operations:

- **`sum()`**: Sum of all elements in an iterable.
- **`min()`** and **`max()`**: Minimum and maximum of a list of values.
- **`round()`**: Round a number to a given precision.

```python
# Sum of a list
total = sum([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(total)  # Outputs: 10

# Maximum of a list
maximum = max(3, 9, 12, 7)
print(maximum)  # Outputs: 12

# Rounding a number
rounded = round(3.14159, 2)
print(rounded)  # Outputs: 3.14
```

## ### Basic string operations
### Concatenation
You can combine (concatenate) strings using the + operator.
```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)  # Outputs: Hello World
```
### Repetition
Repeat a string multiple times using the * operator.
```python
str1 = "Hello"
result = str1 * 3
print(result)  # Outputs: HelloHelloHello
```
### Length of a String
Use the len() function to find the length of a string.
```python
str1 = "Hello"
length = len(str1)
print(length)  # Outputs: 5
```

## ### String indexing and slicing
### Indexing
Access individual characters in a string using indexing. Python uses 0-based indexing.
```python
str1 = "Hello"
first_char = str1[0]
last_char = str1[-1]
print(first_char)  # Outputs: H
print(last_char)   # Outputs: o
```
### Slicing
Extract a substring using slicing. The syntax is string[start:end:step].
```python
str1 = "Hello World"
substring = str1[0:5]  # Slices from index 0 to 4
print(substring)  # Outputs: Hello

reversed_str = str1[::-1]  # Reverse the string
print(reversed_str)  # Outputs: dlroW olleH
```

## ### String methods
Python provides many built-in string methods for common text operations.

### Changing case
Convert to uppercase or lowercase.
```python
str1 = "Hello World"
print(str1.upper())  # Outputs: HELLO WORLD
print(str1.lower())  # Outputs: hello world
print(str1.title())  # Outputs: Hello World
```
### Trimming Whitespaces
Remove leading and trailing whitespace using `strip()`. Use `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` to remove from the left or right side only.
```python
str1 = "  Hello World  "
print(str1.strip())
# Outputs: "Hello World"

print(str1.lstrip())
# Outputs: "Hello World  "

print(str1.rstrip())
# Outputs: "  Hello World"
```

### Finding and Replacing Substrings
Locate a substring using `find()` or `index()`. Replace a substring with another using `replace()`.
```python
str1 = "Hello World"
position = str1.find("World")
print(position)  # Outputs: 6

replaced_str = str1.replace("World", "Python")
print(replaced_str)  # Outputs: Hello Python
```

### Splitting and Joining Strings
Split a string into a list of substrings using `split()`. Combine a list of strings into a single string using `join()`.
```python
str1 = "Hello World, Welcome to Python"
words = str1.split()  # Default split by spaces
print(words)  # Outputs: ['Hello', 'World,', 'Welcome', 'to', 'Python']

joined_str = " ".join(words)
print(joined_str)  # Outputs: Hello World, Welcome to Python
```

## ### Formatting strings
Python offers several ways to format strings:

### Old-Style Formatting (`%`)
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_str = "Name: %s, Age: %d" % (name, age)
print(formatted_str)  # Outputs: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

### `str.format()` method
```python
formatted_str = "Name: {}, Age: {}".format(name, age)
print(formatted_str)  # Outputs: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

### f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
```python
formatted_str = f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}"
print(formatted_str)  # Outputs: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

## ### Regular expressions
For more complex text manipulations, Python provides the re module, which supports regular expressions.

### Searching with regular expressions
```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
match = re.search(r'\bfox\b', text)
if match:
    print("Found:", match.group())  # Outputs: Found: fox
```

### Replacing with regular expressions
```python
result = re.sub(r'fox', 'cat', text)
print(result)  # Outputs: The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog.
```

### Extracting data
```python
text = "My phone number is 123-456-7890."
phone_number = re.findall(r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}', text)
print(phone_number)  # Outputs: ['123-456-7890']
```

## ### Working with multiline strings
You can define and manipulate multiline strings using triple quotes.

```python
multiline_str = """This is
a multiline
string."""
print(multiline_str)
```

## ### Advanced string manipulations
### Reversing a string
```python
str1 = "Python"
reversed_str = str1[::-1]
print(reversed_str)  # Outputs: nohtyP
```

### Checking for substrings
```python
str1 = "Hello World"
contains_hello = "Hello" in str1
print(contains_hello)  # Outputs: True
```

### Counting substrings
```python
str1 = "banana"
count_a = str1.count("a")
print(count_a)  # Outputs: 3
```

## ### Text encoding and decoding
Python strings are Unicode by default. You can encode and decode strings to/from different encodings.

```python
str1 = "Hello World"
encoded_str = str1.encode('utf-8')
print(encoded_str)  # Outputs: b'Hello World'

decoded_str = encoded_str.decode('utf-8')
print(decoded_str)  # Outputs: Hello World
```

## ### Creating lists
You can create a list using square brackets [] or the list() function.

### Empty List
```python
empty_list = []
empty_list_alternative = list()
```

## List with elements
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
```

## ### Accessing list elements
You can access elements in a list using indexing and slicing.

### Indexing
Python uses 0-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index `0`.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first_element = numbers[0]
last_element = numbers[-1]  # Access the last element
print(first_element)  # Outputs: 1
print(last_element)   # Outputs: 5
```

### Slicing
Slicing allows you to extract a portion of the list. The syntax is `list[start:end:step]`.
```python
subset = numbers[1:4]  # Extracts elements from index 1 to 3
print(subset)  # Outputs: [2, 3, 4]

every_other = numbers[::2]  # Extract every second element
print(every_other)  # Outputs: [1, 3, 5]
```

## ### Modifying lists
Lists are mutable, so you can change their contents.

### Changing Elements
```python
numbers[0] = 10
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Adding elements
- **`append()`**: Adds an element to the end of the list.
- **`insert()`**: Adds an element at a specific position.
- **`extend()`**: Extends the list by appending all the items from another list.

```python
numbers.append(6)  # Adds 6 to the end of the list
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

numbers.insert(1, 15)  # Inserts 15 at index 1
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 15, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

numbers.extend([7, 8, 9])  # Adds multiple elements to the end
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 15, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Removing elements
- **`remove()`**: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
- **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the element at the given index (or the last element if no index is specified).
- **`clear()`**: Removes all elements from the list.

```python
numbers.remove(15)  # Removes the first occurrence of 15
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

last_element = numbers.pop()  # Removes and returns the last element
print(last_element)  # Outputs: 9
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

numbers.clear()  # Removes all elements
print(numbers)  # Outputs: []
```

## ### List operations
Python provides several operations that can be performed on lists.

### Concatenation
Combine two lists using the + operator.
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_list = list1 + list2
print(combined_list)  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Repetition
Repeat a list multiple times using the * operator.
```python
repeated_list = list1 * 3
print(repeated_list)  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Membership
Check if an item exists in the list using the in keyword.
```python
print(2 in list1)  # Outputs: True
print(10 in list1)  # Outputs: False
```

## ### Iterating over lists
You can iterate over lists using loops.

### For loop
```python
for number in list1:
    print(number)
```

### While loop
```python
i = 0
while i < len(list1):
    print(list1[i])
    i += 1
```

## ### List comprehensions
List comprehensions offer a concise way to create lists.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)  # Outputs: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

List comprehensions can also include conditional logic.

```python
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)  # Outputs: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

## ### Nested lists
Lists can contain other lists, creating a multi-dimensional array.

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Accessing an element in a nested list
element = matrix[1][2]
print(element)  # Outputs: 6
```

## ### Sorting and reversing lists
Python provides methods to sort and reverse lists.

### Sorting
Use `sort()` to sort the list in place or `sorted()` to return a new sorted list.
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

reversed_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
print(reversed_numbers)  # Outputs: [9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
```

### Reversing
Use `reverse()` to reverse the list in place.
```python
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)  # Outputs: [9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
```

## ### Copying lists
Copying lists can be done in several ways:

- **Shallow copy**: Use the `copy()` method or slicing.
```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
copied_list = original_list.copy()
another_copy = original_list[:]
```

- **Deep copy**: For nested lists, use the `copy` module to perform a deep copy.
```python
import copy
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
```

## ### List methods
Here are some common list methods:

- **`append(x)`**: Adds an item `x` to the end of the list.
- **`extend(iterable)`**: Extends the list by appending elements from an iterable.
- **`insert(i, x)`**: Inserts an item `x` at a given position `i`.
- **`remove(x)`**: Removes the first occurrence of an item `x`.
- **`pop([i])`**: Removes and returns the item at index `i` (last item if `i` is omitted).
- **`clear()`**: Removes all items from the list.
- **`index(x, [start, [end]])`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item `x`.
- **`count(x)`**: Returns the number of occurrences of an item `x`.
- **`sort(key=None, reverse=False)`**: Sorts the list in place.
- **`reverse()`**: Reverses the elements of the list in place.

## ### Basic `if` statement
The basic syntax of an `if` statement in Python is:

```python
if condition:
    # code block to execute if the condition is True
```

Example:
```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```
In this example, because x is greater than 5, the message "x is greater than 5" will be printed.

## ### `if-else` statement
You can use an `else` clause to specify a block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.

```python
if condition:
    # code block to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # code block to execute if the condition is False
```

Example:
```python
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```
In this example, because x is not greater than 5, the message "x is not greater than 5" will be printed.

## ### `if-elif-else` statement
The `elif` (short for "else if") statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. The first condition that evaluates to `True` will have its corresponding code block executed.

```python
if condition1:
    # code block to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code block to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # code block to execute if neither condition1 nor condition2 is True
```

Example:
```python
x = 8

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```
In this example, the message "x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10" will be printed because `x` is 8.

## ### Nested `if` statements
You can nest if statements within other `if`, `elif` or `else` blocks. This allows you to check multiple conditions at different levels.

```python
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # code block to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are True
    else:
        # code block to execute if condition1 is True and condition2 is False
else:
    # code block to execute if condition1 is False
```

Example:
```python
x = 12
y = 5

if x > 10:
    if y > 10:
        print("Both x and y are greater than 10")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 10, but y is not")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
```
In this example, because `x` is greater than 10 but `y` is not, the message "x is greater than 10, but y is not" will be printed.

## ### Comparison operators
These operators are used to compare two values:

- **`==`** Equal to
- **`!=`** Not equal to
- **`>`** Greater than
- **`<`** Less than
- **`>=`** Greater than or equal to
- **`<=`** Less than or equal to


## ### Logical operators
These operators are used to combine multiple conditions:

- **`and`** returns `True` if both conditions are `True`
- **`or`** returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`
- **`not`** reverses the result, returns `False` if the result is `True`

Example:
```python
x = 7
y = 10

if x > 5 and y < 15:
    print("x is greater than 5 and y is less than 15")

if x == 7 or y == 12:
    print("Either x is 7 or y is 12")

if not (x == 5):
    print("x is not equal to 5")
```

## ### Ternary (conditional) operator
Python also supports a conditional expression (often referred to as the ternary operator) that allows you to write an `if-else` statement in a single line.

```python
value = a if condition else b
```

Example:
```python
x = 5
result = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)  # Outputs: Odd
```

## ### Basic `for` loop
The basic syntax of a for loop is:

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code block to execute for each item in the sequence
```
Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
In this example, the `for` loop iterates over the list `fruits`, and for each item in the list, it prints the item. The output will be:

```python
apple
banana
cherry
```

## ### Using `for` with `range()`
The `range()` function is commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. The syntax of range() is as follows:
- **`range(stop)`**: Generates numbers from `0` to `stop-1`.
- **`range(start, stop)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1`.
- **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1`, incrementing by `step`.

Examples:
```python
# Iterating over a range of numbers from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
```python
# Iterating over a range of numbers from 2 to 6
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)
```
Output:
```
2
3
4
5
6
```
```python
# Iterating over a range of numbers from 1 to 10, stepping by 2
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```
Output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## ### Iterating over strings
You can use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in a string.

Example:
```python
message = "Hello"

for char in message:
    print(char)
```
Output:
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

## ### Iterating over lists of lists (nested loops)
When dealing with lists of lists (like matrices), you can use nested `for` loops to iterate through each element.

Example:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()
```
Output:
```
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
```

## ### Using for with `enumerate()`
The `enumerate()` function is useful when you need both the index and the value from the sequence during iteration.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```
Output:
```
Index 0: apple
Index 1: banana
Index 2: cherry
```

## ### Using for with `zip()`
The `zip()` function allows you to iterate over multiple sequences in parallel.

Example:
```python
names = ["John", "Jane", "Doe"]
ages = [25, 30, 22]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```
Output:
```
John is 25 years old
Jane is 30 years old
Doe is 22 years old
```

## ### `for` with `else`
Python allows you to use an `else` block after a `for` loop. The `else` block will execute after the loop finishes, unless the loop is terminated with a `break` statement.

Example without `break`:
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
Loop finished
```
Example with `break`:
```python
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```
Output:
```
0
```
In this example, the `else` block does not execute because the loop was terminated early with `break`.

## ### `break` and `continue` in `for` loops
- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

Example using break:
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
```

Example using continue:
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
4
```

## ### Basic `while` loop
The basic syntax of a while loop is:
```python
while condition:
    # code block to execute while the condition is True
```

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a `while` loop:
```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
In this example:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- It prints the value of `i` and then increments `i` by 1.
- The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5.
- Once `i` becomes 6, the condition `i <= 5` is false, so the loop stops.

## ### `pass` statement
The `pass` statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed. It's used as a placeholder in situations where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed or when the actual code is not yet implemented.

### Creating empty functions or classes
When you're defining a function or class that you haven't implemented yet, you can use `pass` to avoid syntax errors. This allows you to define the structure of your program without having to write the actual code immediately.

Example:
```python
def my_function():
    pass

class MyClass:
    pass
```
In this example, `my_function` and `MyClass` are placeholders that you can come back to later and implement.

## ### Why use `pass`?
- **Placeholder for future code**: It allows you to outline the structure of your code without implementing the details immediately.

- **Prevent syntax errors**: Python requires a code block in certain situations (e.g., after a function or class definition). Using `pass` ensures that your code is syntactically correct even if you havenâ€™t written the implementation yet.

- **Readability**: It makes the intent clear to anyone reading your code that you plan to add code later, or that no action is intentionally required.

## ### `pass`: Difference from `continue` and `break`
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

- **`break`**: Exits the loop entirely.

- **`pass`**: Does nothing; it simply acts as a placeholder and can be used anywhere a statement is syntactically required.

## ### `match` statement
The `match` statement is a feature introduced in Python 3.10 as part of Structural Pattern Matching, which allows for more expressive and readable ways to handle complex conditional logic. Itâ€™s similar to the `switch` statements found in other languages but is more powerful and flexible.

The basic syntax of a match statement is:
```python
match value:
    case pattern1:
        # Code block for pattern1
    case pattern2:
        # Code block for pattern2
    case _:
        # Code block for the default case (similar to 'else' or 'default')
```

Here's an example that demonstrates how a match statement can be used to handle different cases:
```python
def describe_number(x):
    match x:
        case 0:
            return "Zero"
        case 1:
            return "One"
        case _:
            return "Something else"

print(describe_number(0))  # Output: Zero
print(describe_number(1))  # Output: One
print(describe_number(42)) # Output: Something else
```
In this example:
- `x` is the value being matched.
- If `x` is `0`, it returns "Zero".
- If `x` is `1`, it returns "One".
- The underscore `_` is used as a wildcard pattern to match any value not covered by previous cases, acting as the default case.

## ### `match` statement: Matching multiple patterns
You can match multiple patterns in the same case statement by separating them with a pipe (|), which acts as an "or" operator.

```python
def describe_number(x):
    match x:
        case 0 | 1:
            return "Zero or One"
        case _:
            return "Something else"

print(describe_number(0))  # Output: Zero or One
print(describe_number(1))  # Output: Zero or One
print(describe_number(42)) # Output: Something else
```

## ### `match` statement: Matching with conditions (guards)
You can add an `if` condition (called a "guard") to a `case` statement to further refine the match.
```python
def describe_number(x):
    match x:
        case 0:
            return "Zero"
        case _ if x > 0:
            return "Positive"
        case _:
            return "Negative"

print(describe_number(10))  # Output: Positive
print(describe_number(-5))  # Output: Negative
```

## ### Destructuring in match statements: Tuples
`match` statements can also destructure sequences and objects, making it possible to directly match complex data structures.

```python
def point_location(point):
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            return "Origin"
        case (x, 0):
            return f"On the X-axis at {x}"
        case (0, y):
            return f"On the Y-axis at {y}"
        case (x, y):
            return f"At coordinates ({x}, {y})"
        case _:
            return "Not a point"

print(point_location((0, 0)))    # Output: Origin
print(point_location((3, 0)))    # Output: On the X-axis at 3
print(point_location((0, 4)))    # Output: On the Y-axis at 4
print(point_location((2, 5)))    # Output: At coordinates (2, 5)
```

## ### Destructuring in match statements: Lists
```python
def list_info(lst):
    match lst:
        case []:
            return "Empty list"
        case [x]:
            return f"List with one element: {x}"
        case [x, y]:
            return f"List with two elements: {x}, {y}"
        case [x, *rest]:
            return f"List starts with {x} and has more elements: {rest}"
        case _:
            return "Unknown list format"

# Output: Empty list
print(list_info([]))

# Output: List with one element: 1
print(list_info([1]))

# Output: List with two elements: 1, 2
print(list_info([1, 2])) 

# Output: List starts with 1 and has more elements: [2, 3, 4]
print(list_info([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

## ### `match`: Matching named attributes in objects
You can match against attributes of objects, which is useful for working with classes.

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

def describe_point(point):
    match point:
        case Point(0, 0):
            return "Origin"

        case Point(x, y):
            return f"Point at ({x}, {y})"

p1 = Point(0, 0)
p2 = Point(3, 4)

print(describe_point(p1))  # Output: Origin

print(describe_point(p2))  # Output: Point at (3, 4)
```

## ### Basic function definition
The basic syntax for defining a function in Python is:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring (optional): A brief description of what the function does."""
    # Code block
    return result  # (optional)
```
- **`def`**: A keyword used to start the function definition.

- **`function_name`**: The name you give to the function. Function names should follow naming conventions, typically using lowercase letters and underscores.

- **`parameters`**: Variables listed inside the parentheses, representing inputs to the function.

- **`return`**: (Optional) A statement used to return a value from the function.

## ### Example of a simple function
Hereâ€™s an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """This function adds two numbers and returns the result."""
    result = a + b
    return result
```
You can call this function like so:
```python
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 8
```

## ### Function with default parameters
You can define default values for function parameters. If a caller doesnâ€™t provide a value for a parameter, the default value is used.

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    """This function greets the person with the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function with an argument
print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!

# Calling the function without an argument
print(greet())  # Output: Hello, Guest!
```

## ### Using `*args` for variable length positional arguments
Python allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` for positional arguments.
```python
def sum_all(*args):
    """This function returns the sum of all the provided arguments."""
    return sum(args)

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
print(sum_all(10, 20, 30, 40))  # Output: 100
```

## ### Using `**kwargs` for variable length keyword arguments
Python allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments using  `**kwargs` for keyword arguments.
```python
def print_details(**kwargs):
    """This function prints details provided as keyword arguments."""
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_details(name="Alice", age=25, city="New York")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 25
# city: New York
```

## ### Returning multiple values from a function
Python functions can return multiple values as a tuple:
```python
def calculate(a, b):
    """This function returns the sum and difference of two numbers."""
    sum_result = a + b
    diff_result = a - b
    return sum_result, diff_result

sum_val, diff_val = calculate(10, 5)
print(f"Sum: {sum_val}, Difference: {diff_val}")
# Output: Sum: 15, Difference: 5
```

## ### Lambda functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. They can have any number of input parameters but only one expression.

```python
# A lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y

# Using the lambda function
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```
Lambda functions are often used for short, simple functions that are passed as arguments to other functions e.g., in `map()`, `filter()` or `sorted()`.

## ### Docstrings
A docstring is a string that describes what the function does. Itâ€™s placed as the first statement in the function body and is enclosed in triple quotes. Docstrings are useful for documenting code and can be accessed using the `help()` function or the `__doc__ attribute.
`
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """This function multiplies two numbers and returns the result."""
    return a * b

# Accessing the docstring
print(multiply.__doc__)
```

## ### Nested functions
Functions can be defined inside other functions, creating nested functions. Nested functions are useful for encapsulating helper functions or creating closures.

```python
def outer_function(x):
    """This is the outer function."""

    def inner_function(y):
        """This is the inner function."""
        return x + y

    return inner_function

# Using the outer function to get an inner function
add_five = outer_function(5)
print(add_five(10))  # Output: 15
```

## ### Closures
A closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory.

```python
def outer_function(x):
    """This function returns a function that adds x to its argument."""
    
    def inner_function(y):
        return x + y
    
    return inner_function

add_ten = outer_function(10)
print(add_ten(5))  # Output: 15
```
In this example, `add_ten` is a closure that remembers the value `10` for `x`, even though `outer_function` has finished execution.

## ### Decorators
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function. They are often used for logging, access control, memoization, and more. A decorator is a function that takes in a function as an input argument and returns a supplemented copy of that function.

Decorators can be nested and decorators allow you to increase/expand the already implemented functionality. You can also pass arguments to the decorated function or the decorator itself.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Something is happening before the function is called.
# Hello!
# Something is happening after the function is called.
```

## ### Using lists as stacks
In Python, lists are versatile data structures that can be used as stacks. A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added is the first one to be removed.

### Basic stack operations with lists
Python lists provide built-in methods to implement stack operations:

- **`append()`** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **`pop()`** Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

## ### Pushing an item onto the stack
To add an item to the stack, use the `append()` method. This operation pushes an item onto the end of the list, which is considered the top of the stack.

Example:
```python
stack = []

# Push items onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

print(stack)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
In this example, the elements `1`, `2` and `3` are added to the stack.

## ### Popping an item from the stack
To remove and return the item from the top of the stack, use the `pop()` method. This operation removes the last element in the list.

Example:
```python
# Pop items from the stack
top_item = stack.pop()
print(top_item)  # Output: 3

print(stack)  # Output: [1, 2]
```
In this example, 3 is the last element added to the stack, so it is the first one to be removed.

## ### Checking if the stack is empty
Before popping an item from the stack, it's good practice to check if the stack is empty to avoid errors.

Example:
```python
if stack:
    top_item = stack.pop()
    print("Popped item:", top_item)
else:
    print("Stack is empty")
```

## ### Peeking at the top item
If you want to look at the top item of the stack without removing it, you can simply access the last item in the list using `stack[-1]`.

Example:
```python
# Peek at the top item without popping it
if stack:
    top_item = stack[-1]
    print("Top item:", top_item)  # Output: 2
else:
    print("Stack is empty")
```

## ### Complete stack example
Hereâ€™s a complete example that demonstrates pushing, popping, and peeking:

```python
# Initialize an empty stack
stack = []

# Push items onto the stack
stack.append('A')
stack.append('B')
stack.append('C')

print("Stack after pushing:", stack)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C']

# Peek at the top item
if stack:
    print("Top item:", stack[-1])  # Output: 'C'

# Pop an item from the stack
top_item = stack.pop()
print("Popped item:", top_item)  # Output: 'C'
print("Stack after popping:", stack)  # Output: ['A', 'B']

# Pop all items
while stack:
    print("Popped:", stack.pop())

print("Stack is now empty:", stack)  # Output: []
```

## ### Stack underflow
If you try to pop an item from an empty stack, Python will raise an IndexError. You can handle this using a try-except block or by checking if the stack is empty before popping.

Example:
```python
try:
    stack.pop()
except IndexError:
    print("Cannot pop from an empty stack!")
```

## ### Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful when you need to store items without duplicates and when you require fast membership testing (i.e., checking whether an item is in the set). Sets are also ideal for performing mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### Creating sets
Sets can be created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function. However, to create an empty set, you must use `set()` as `{}` creates an empty dictionary.

Example:
```python
# Creating a set with some elements
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

# Creating an empty set
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)  # Output: set()

# Using the set() function to create a set from an iterable
letters = set("hello")
print(letters)  # Output: {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}
```

## ### Sets: Adding elements
You can add a single element to a set using the `add()` method or multiple elements using the update() method.

```python
# Adding a single element
fruits.add("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# Adding multiple elements
fruits.update(["mango", "grape"])
print(fruits)  # Output: {'banana', 'cherry', 'grape', 'mango', 'orange', 'apple'}
```

## ### Sets: Removing elements
You can remove elements using `remove()` or `discard()`. The difference is that `remove()` will raise a `KeyError` if the element is not found, while `discard()` will not.

```python
# Removing an element
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'cherry', 'grape', 'mango', 'orange', 'apple'}

# Discarding an element
fruits.discard("apple")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'cherry', 'grape', 'mango', 'orange'}

# Trying to remove a non-existent element with discard (no error)
fruits.discard("banana")  # No error
```

## ### Sets: Clearing all elements
You can remove all elements from a set using the `clear()` method.

```python
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # Output: set()
```

## ### Set operations: Union (`|` or `union()`)
Combines elements from both sets, without duplicates.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

union_set = set1 | set2
# or
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## ### Set operations: Intersection (`&` or `intersection()`)
Returns elements that are common to both sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

intersection_set = set1 & set2
# or
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)

print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}
```

## ### Set operations: Difference (`-` or `difference()`)
Returns elements that are in the first set but not in the second.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

difference_set = set1 - set2
# or
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)

print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

## ### Set operations: Symmetric difference (`^` or `symmetric_difference()`)
Returns elements that are in either set, but not in both.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2
# or
symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

## ### Set operations: Useful set methods
- **`len(set)`** Returns the number of elements in the set.

- **`in keyword`** Checks if an element is in the set.

- **`issubset()`** Checks if the set is a subset of another set.

- **`issuperset()`** Checks if the set is a superset of another set.

- **`copy()`** Creates a shallow copy of the set.

## ### Frozen sets
A frozen set is an immutable version of a set. Once created, elements cannot be added or removed. Frozen sets are useful for situations where you need an immutable set, such as using it as a key in a dictionary.

Example:
```python
frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})

# Attempting to modify a frozen set will raise an error
# frozen_set.add(5)  # Raises AttributeError
```

## ### Dictionaries
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and the key acts as a unique identifier for that value within the dictionary. Dictionaries are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python because they allow for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys.

### Creating a dictionary
You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. Alternatively, you can use the `dict()` function.

Examples:
```python
# Creating a dictionary with curly braces
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Creating a dictionary using the dict() function
person2 = dict(name="Bob", age=25, city="Los Angeles")

print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print(person2) # Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}
```

## ### Dictionaries: Accessing values
You can access the value associated with a specific key using the square bracket notation `[]` or the `get()` method.

Examples:
```python
# Accessing values using square brackets
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Accessing values using the get() method
print(person.get("age"))  # Output: 30

# Using get() with a default value if the key is not found
print(person.get("address", "Unknown"))  # Output: Unknown
```

## ### Dictionaries: Adding and updating elements
You can add new key-value pairs or update the value of an existing key by assigning a value to the key using square brackets.

Examples:
```python
# Adding a new key-value pair
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}

# Updating the value of an existing key
person["age"] = 31
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
```

## ### Dictionaries: Removing elements
You can remove elements from a dictionary using the `del` statement, the `pop()` method or the `popitem()` method.

Examples:
```python
# Removing an element using del
del person["email"]
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}

# Removing an element using pop()
age = person.pop("age")
print(age)     # Output: 31
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York'}

# Removing the last inserted key-value pair using popitem()
last_item = person.popitem()
print(last_item)  # Output: ('city', 'New York')
print(person)     # Output: {'name': 'Alice'}
```

## ### Dictionaries: Useful methods
- **`keys()`** Returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

- **`values()`** Returns a view object that displays a list of all the values in the dictionary.

- **`items()`** Returns a view object that displays a list of key-value pairs (tuples) in the dictionary.

- **`update()`** Updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable of key-value pairs.

## ### Dictionaries: Checking for keys
You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the in keyword.

```python
if "name" in person:
    print("Name is in the dictionary")
```

## ### Dictionaries: Iterating over a dictionary
You can iterate over keys, values` or key-value pairs in a dictionary using a `for` loop.

Examples:
```python
# Iterating over keys
for key in person.keys():
    print(key)

# Iterating over values
for value in person.values():
    print(value)

# Iterating over key-value pairs
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## ### Dictionaries: Dictionary comprehensions
You can create dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create dictionaries from iterables.

Example:
```python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

## ### Dictionaries: Nested dictionaries
A dictionary can contain another dictionary, allowing for complex data structures.

Example:
```python
students = {
    "Alice": {"age": 25, "grade": "A"},
    "Bob": {"age": 22, "grade": "B"}
}

print(students["Alice"]["grade"])  # Output: A
```

## ### Dictionaries: Copying dictionaries
To create a copy of a dictionary, use the `copy()` method or the `dict()` function. Simply using the assignment operator `=` will create a reference to the same dictionary, not a copy.

Example:
```python
original = {"one": 1, "two": 2}
copy1 = original.copy()
copy2 = dict(original)

# Modifying the copy won't affect the original
copy1["one"] = "ONE"
print(original)  # Output: {'one': 1, 'two': 2}
print(copy1)     # Output: {'one': 'ONE', 'two': 2}
```

## ### Python modules
In Python, modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables, etc.) that can be reused in other programs. Using modules helps organize code into logical units and promotes code reuse. A Python module is simply a `.py` file that can be imported into another Python file to access its functions, classes, and variables.

### Creating a module
To create a module, you just need to write Python code in a file and save it with a `.py` extension.

Example:
Let's say you have a file named `mymodule.py` with the following code:

```python
# mymodule.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

pi = 3.14159
```
Here, `mymodule.py` contains a function `greet()` and a variable `pi`.

## ### Importing a module
You can import a module into another Python file using the `import` statement.

Example:
```python
# main.py

import mymodule

# Accessing the function and variable from mymodule
message = mymodule.greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!

print(mymodule.pi)  # Output: 3.14159
```
In this example, the `mymodule` module is imported, and its function `greet()` and variable `pi` are accessed.

## ### Different ways to import modules
There are several ways to import modules or specific items from modules.

1. Importing the entire module
```python
import mymodule
```
You need to use the module name when calling its functions or variables, like `mymodule.greet()`.

2. Importing specific functions or variables
You can import specific items from a module using the `from ... import` syntax.
```python
from mymodule import greet, pi

# Now you can use greet and pi directly
print(greet("Bob")) # Output: Hello, Bob!
print(pi)  # Output: 3.14159
```

3. Importing all items from a module
You can import everything from a module using the `from ... import *` syntax, but this is generally not recommended because it can lead to conflicts with existing names.

```python
from mymodule import *

# Now you can use everything from mymodule without prefixing it
print(greet("Eve"))  # Output: Hello, Eve!
print(pi)            # Output: 3.14159
```

4. Using aliases
You can assign an alias to a module using the `as` keyword to shorten the module name or avoid conflicts.

```python
import mymodule as mm

# Using the alias to call the function
print(mm.greet("Charlie"))  # Output: Hello, Charlie!
```

## ### Built-in Python modules
Python comes with many built-in modules that provide common functionality. Some common built-in modules are:

- **`math`**: Provides mathematical functions.
- **`random`**: Provides functions for generating random numbers.
- **`os`**: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- **`sys`**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
- **`datetime`**: Provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

Example of using built-in modules:
```python
import math
import random

# Output: 4.0
print(math.sqrt(16))

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
print(random.randint(1, 10))
```

## ### Installing third-party modules
Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules that you can install using `pip`, the Python package manager. These modules are hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed using the command:

```bash
pip install <module-name>
```
For example, to install the popular requests module for making HTTP requests, run:

```bash
pip install requests
```
Once installed, you can import the module into your code:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)  # Output: 200 (if successful)
```

## ### Finding the location of modules
You can find where a module is located on your system by checking the `__file__` attribute.

### Example:
```python
import os

print(os.__file__)  # Outputs the path to the os module
```

## ### Module search path (`sys.path`)
When you import a module, Python searches for it in directories listed in the `sys.path` variable. This includes:

- The directory containing the current script.
- The directories listed in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (if set).
- The default directories where Python is installed.

You can view the search path by importing the `sys` module and printing `sys.path`.

Example:
```python
import sys

print(sys.path)  # Outputs the list of directories Python searches for modules
```

## ### Module initialization code
When a module is imported, all top-level code (not inside functions or classes) in the module is executed. You can use this feature to initialize data when the module is imported.

Example:
```python
# mymodule.py
print("Module mymodule has been imported")

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
When you import `mymodule`, you'll see:

```python
import mymodule
# Output: Module mymodule has been imported
```

## ### Packages
A package is a way to organize related modules into directories. A package is essentially a directory containing a special `__init__.py` file and multiple modules.

Example structure:
```markdown
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```
In this case, `mypackage` is a package and `module1.py` and `module2.py` are modules inside that package. You can import modules from the package like this:

```python
from mypackage import module1
```

## ### Defining a class
Classes are used to define new types of objects, encapsulating both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single structure. Python classes are a fundamental aspect of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which helps in structuring code to make it more modular, reusable, and scalable.

### Defining a class
A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, methods (functions) and attributes (variables) are defined.

Basic class syntax
```python
class MyClass:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    class_attribute = "I am a class attribute"
    
    # Constructor method (called when a new instance is created)
    def __init__(self, attribute_value):
        # Instance attribute (unique to each instance)
        self.instance_attribute = attribute_value

    # Instance method (operates on an instance)
    def display(self):
        print(f"Class attribute: {self.class_attribute}")
        print(f"Instance attribute: {self.instance_attribute}")
```
In this example:
- `class_attribute`: A class attribute that is shared by all instances of the class.

- `__init__`: The constructor method, which is called when an instance (object) of the class is created. It initializes the instance with attributes.

- `self`: Refers to the current instance of the class. It must be the first parameter in instance methods to access instance-specific data.

## ### Creating objects (instances)
You can create an instance (object) of a class by calling the class name like a function. This will invoke the `__init__` method to initialize the object.

Example: Creating an object
```python
# Creating an object of MyClass
obj = MyClass("Instance attribute value")

# Accessing methods and attributes
obj.display()
# Output: Class attribute: I am a class attribute
# Instance attribute: Instance attribute value
```
In this example, obj is an instance of `MyClass`. The method `display()` prints both the class and instance attributes.

## ### Instance attributes vs. class attributes
- **Class attributes** are shared by all instances of the class. Changing the value of a class attribute will affect all instances.
- **Instance attributes** are unique to each instance. Changing the value of an instance attribute will affect only that specific instance.

Example of class and instance attributes
```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute (all cars have 4 wheels)

    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Instance attribute (each car has its own color)

# Creating two objects
car1 = Car("red")
car2 = Car("blue")

# Accessing attributes
print(car1.color)  # Output: red
print(car2.color)  # Output: blue

# Accessing class attribute
print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4
print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4
```

## ### Instance methods
Instance methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on instances of the class. They must take `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance on which the method is called.

Example: Instance method
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is barking!")

# Creating an instance and calling an instance method
dog = Dog("Buddy")
dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy is barking!
```

## ### Class methods
A class method operates on the class itself rather than on instances. To define a class method, use the `@classmethod` decorator. The first parameter of a class method is `cls`, which refers to the class.

Example: Class method
```python
class Animal:
    species_count = 0

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Animal.species_count += 1

    @classmethod
    def total_species(cls):
        print(f"Total species count: {cls.species_count}")

# Creating instances
a1 = Animal("Lion")
a2 = Animal("Tiger")

# Calling class method
Animal.total_species()  # Output: Total species count: 2
```

## ### Static methods
A static method doesnâ€™t access or modify the class or instance data. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the classâ€™s namespace. Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.

Example: Static method
```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

# Calling static method
result = MathOperations.add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

## ### Inheritance
Python supports inheritance, which allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This is useful for creating a hierarchy of classes that share behavior.
- **Base class (parent)**: The class being inherited from.
- **Derived class (child)**: The class that inherits from the base class.

Example: Inheritance
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

# Derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks.")

# Using inheritance
dog = Dog("Buddy")
dog.speak()  # Output: Buddy barks.
```
Here, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `speak()` method.

## ### Method overriding
When a derived class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the base class, it overrides the base class method. The overridden method will be called instead of the base class method.

Example: Method overriding
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks
```

## ### The super() function
The `super()` function allows you to call methods from the parent class in a derived class. This is useful when you want to extend the functionality of a method in the derived class but still use the base classâ€™s implementation.

Example: Using `super()`
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        # Call the parent class's constructor
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        # Call the parent class's speak method
        super().speak()
        print(f"{self.name} barks.")

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog.speak()
```

## ### Encapsulation
In Python, data encapsulation is achieved by restricting access to certain attributes and methods using leading underscores `_` or `__`.

- **Single leading underscore** (`_attribute`): Protected, a convention to indicate that the attribute is intended for internal use.
- **Double leading underscores** (`__attribute`): Private, name mangling is applied, making the attribute harder to access from outside the class.

Example: Encapsulation
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self._age = age  # This is meant to be "protected"

    def display(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self._age}")

person = Person("John", 30)
person.display()

print(person._age)  # Accessing protected attribute (though it's just a convention)
```

## ### What is LEGB Rule?
The LEGB Rule in Python describes the order in which Python looks for variable names when you reference them. Itâ€™s about scope resolution â€” that is, where Python searches for a name you use in your code.

- Local - Names assigned inside a function (or lambda) â€” the innermost scope.
- Enclosing - Names in the local scope of any and all enclosing functions, starting from the innermost.
- Global - Names assigned at the top-level of a module or declared as `global` inside a function.
- Built-in - Names preassigned in Python's built-in scope (like `len()`, `sum()`, etc.).

If Python canâ€™t find the name in any of these places, it will raise a `NameError`.

Important:
- You can read variables from outer scopes without declaring anything special.
- But if you assign a variable inside a function, it becomes local to that function by default.
  - Use `global` to assign to a global variable inside a function.
  - Use `nonlocal` to assign to an enclosing variable inside a nested function.

## ### Namespaces vs. Scopes
- A namespace is a mapping of names to objects. Namespaces define what names exist.
- A scope determines the visibility and lifetime of those names. Scopes define where you can access a name.
