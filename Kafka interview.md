Here’s how I’d answer these in an interview.

1. Kafka Basics
- What is Kafka and how it differs from traditional queues
  - Distributed streaming platform: durable, high-throughput, append-only commit logs.
  - Pub/sub with persistent storage; consumers can replay from offsets.
  - Versus traditional MQ: Kafka scales via partitions, keeps messages on disk, supports multiple independent consumer groups, emphasizes throughput and replayability; classic MQs often push-and-forget with less replay and lower throughput.

- Topics, partitions, offsets
  - Topic: named stream/category of messages.
  - Partitions: topic is sharded into ordered, append-only logs; unit of parallelism and scaling.
  - Offsets: per-partition monotonically increasing position; consumers track offsets to know where they are.

- Role of ZooKeeper (and now KRaft)
  - Historically: ZooKeeper managed cluster metadata, controller election, topic configs.
  - KRaft (Kafka Raft): built-in metadata quorum replaces ZooKeeper (production-ready in Kafka 3.5+; ZooKeeper removal in 4.x). Simplifies ops, improves scalability, single system for coordination and metadata.

- Producer, consumer, broker
  - Producer: publishes records to topic partitions.
  - Consumer: reads records from topic partitions, tracking offsets.
  - Broker: Kafka server storing partitions and serving producers/consumers; one broker is the controller (in KRaft) for metadata.

- Consumer group
  - Set of consumers sharing a group.id that collectively consume a topic’s partitions (each partition assigned to at most one consumer in the group).
  - Enables horizontal scaling and fault tolerance; multiple groups can read the same topic independently.

2. Message Delivery & Guarantees
- At-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once in Kafka
  - At-most-once: commit offset before processing (no retries) — no duplicates, possible data loss.
  - At-least-once: process then commit (with retries) — no loss, possible duplicates; dedupe downstream if needed.
  - Exactly-once: with idempotent + transactional producer and read_committed consumers (or Kafka Streams EOS) — no loss, no duplicates within Kafka.

- Message durability
  - Replication across brokers (replication.factor).
  - Leader writes to disk (page cache + fsync per flush policy), followers replicate.
  - acks=all with min.insync.replicas enforces durability quorum.
  - CRC checksums, commit logs, recovery from segment indexes.

- Producer acknowledgments (acks)
  - acks=0: fire-and-forget; fastest, risk of loss.
  - acks=1: leader-only ack; faster, risk if leader dies before followers replicate.
  - acks=all (-1): waits for ISR quorum; safest with min.insync.replicas, slower.

3. Performance & Scaling
- How partitioning works and why it’s important
  - Records are routed to partitions; each partition is processed by a single consumer in a group.
  - Enables horizontal scalability, parallelism, and per-partition ordering.

- Key-based partitioning vs round-robin (sticky)
  - Key-based: hash(key) → stable partition; preserves order per key and co-locates related events.
  - Round-robin/sticky (default when no key): batches stick to a partition for a short period to improve batching; better throughput, no per-key ordering.

- Backpressure and consumer lag
  - Producers block when buffer is full (max.block.ms), retries and delivery.timeout.ms control retry behavior.
  - Consumers can pause/resume partitions; tune fetch/max.poll settings; lag indicates consumers can’t keep up.
  - Broker throttles via quotas; flow control on fetch/produce requests.

- Scaling consumers for a topic with N partitions
  - Max effective consumers in a group = number of partitions.
  - Add consumers up to N for parallelism; beyond N, extra consumers sit idle.
  - To scale further: increase partitions (mind rebalancing and key skew), or create additional consumer groups if you need multiple independent readers.

4. Data Handling
- Handling out-of-order messages
  - Ensure same key for related events; use key-based partitioning.
  - Use idempotent producer to avoid reordering on retries.
  - Add sequence numbers/timestamps and reorder in the consumer with bounded buffering/watermarks.
  - Kafka Streams/Flink: event-time windows with grace periods and suppression to handle late/out-of-order events.

- Log compaction and when to use it
  - Compaction keeps only the latest record per key (plus tombstones for deletes).
  - Use for changelog/KTable semantics, CDC, caches where only the latest value matters.

- Retention policy (time/size) vs compaction
  - Retention time/size deletes entire old segments regardless of key.
  - Compaction retains last per-key value indefinitely; you can combine with retention to bound log size (compact + delete).

- Guaranteeing ordering
  - Kafka guarantees order within a partition.
  - To guarantee order for related records: use the same key; keep one consumer per partition in a group.
  - Producer: idempotence on (default true), avoid multiple producers splitting a key across partitions.

5. Kafka in Practice
- Designing a real-time pipeline (example: fraud detection)
  - Ingest: producers publish transactions to topic transactions (partition by account_id).
  - Stream processing: Kafka Streams/Flink job consumes, joins with reference data (changelog topics), maintains per-account state, scores events, emits alerts to alerts topic with EOS.
  - Persistence: sink alerts to DB/Elastic, write enriched events to data lake/warehouse via Kafka Connect.
  - Monitoring: lag, UMs, dead-letter topics for bad messages, dashboards and alerts.

- Kafka Connect usage
  - Framework for running scalable source/sink connectors (JDBC, Debezium CDC, S3, Snowflake, Elasticsearch, etc.).
  - Distributed workers, tasks parallelism, offset management in internal topics, SMTs for lightweight transforms.
  - Reduces custom code for integrations.

- Schema Registry and why it matters
  - Stores schemas (Avro/JSON Schema/Protobuf), enforces compatibility (backward/forward).
  - Enables schema evolution, smaller payloads (no full schema per message), safer contracts across teams and connectors.

6. Operations & Monitoring
- Monitoring Kafka
  - Key metrics: under-replicated/offline partitions, ISR size, request latency, controller health, disk usage, network I/O, GC, page cache hit ratios.
  - Consumer lag: per group/partition lag via __consumer_offsets; tools: Burrow, Kafka Lag Exporter, Prometheus + Grafana, Confluent Control Center.
  - Connect/Streams: task failures, rebalance rates, error rates, DLT volume.

- If a broker goes down
  - Partitions it led will elect a new leader from ISR.
  - If min.insync.replicas can’t be met, acks=all writes will fail (durability preserved).
  - If unclean leader election is enabled (not recommended), leader could be chosen outside ISR → potential data loss.

- Rebalancing consumer groups
  - Triggers on membership changes, new topics/partitions, or slow/failed consumers.
  - Strategies: range, roundrobin, cooperative-sticky (reduces churn).
  - Stabilize with static membership (group.instance.id), tune session.timeout.ms, heartbeat.interval.ms, max.poll.interval.ms; use cooperative rebalancing to avoid stop-the-world.

- Handling poison-pill messages
  - Implement retries with backoff and a dead-letter topic (DLT) carrying headers for traceability.
  - Separate retry topics (e.g., retries-1m, retries-10m) to avoid blocking.
  - In Connect: errors.tolerance=all, errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name.
  - Protect against deserialization failures with error-handling deserializers.

7. Advanced Topics
- Kafka Streams vs Spark Streaming vs Flink
  - Kafka Streams: JVM library, embedded in your app, low-latency record-at-a-time processing, stateful with RocksDB, EOS integrated; best for microservice-aligned streaming.
  - Spark Structured Streaming: micro-batch (some continuous modes), strong SQL/unified batch+stream, higher latency; great for ETL and data engineering on Spark stacks.
  - Flink: true streaming, event-time/processing-time with sophisticated windows, very low latency, strong exactly-once and state management; great for complex streaming analytics.

- Idempotent producer
  - Ensures no duplicates on broker retries; uses producer ID and sequence numbers per partition.
  - Enabled by default (enable.idempotence=true). Preserves per-partition ordering under retries.

- Transactional producer/consumer
  - Producer with transactional.id can atomically write to multiple partitions/topics and commit consumer offsets in the same transaction.
  - Consumers with isolation.level=read_committed only read committed data, enabling end-to-end EOS in Kafka.

- Exactly-once across multiple topics
  - Use a single transactional producer to send to all target topics and sendOffsetsToTransaction to atomically commit source offsets.
  - Consumers read with read_committed. Note: EOS is guaranteed within Kafka; external sinks need transactional support or dedup.

8. Scenario / Troubleshooting
- Consumer reads the same message multiple times
  - Offsets not committed (auto-commit disabled or commit failing).
  - Using different group.id each run or auto.offset.reset=earliest on startup.
  - Long processing times causing rebalances before commit (max.poll.interval.ms too low).
  - Transactions: consumer not using read_committed and seeing aborted/resends.

- Producer throughput is low — tuning steps
  - Increase batch.size, linger.ms to improve batching; use compression (lz4 or zstd).
  - Use acks=1 or all depending on durability; ensure sufficient partitions to parallelize.
  - Increase buffer.memory, max.in.flight.requests.per.connection; ensure idempotence as needed.
  - Check broker: num.network.threads, num.io.threads, socket.* buffers, page cache, disks (NVMe), replication bottlenecks.
  - Network tuning and partition skew; use sticky partitioner for unkeyed traffic.

- Two microservices consume the same topic without interfering
  - Give each service a distinct consumer group; both get all messages independently.
  - If they should share the load, use the same group.

- Consumer lag keeps growing — actions
  - Scale consumers up to number of partitions; increase partitions if needed.
  - Speed up processing: increase max.poll.records, fetch.max.bytes/max.partition.fetch.bytes, tune deserialization, I/O.
  - Increase max.poll.interval.ms to avoid rebalances; use pause/resume during slow processing.
  - Investigate broker health, ISR shrink, throttling, GC pauses; add hardware or optimize topic config.

How Kafka fits into modern ETL and related tools
- Kafka in ETL
  - Real-time ingestion bus decoupling sources and sinks; staging area with replay and backfill.
  - Use Kafka Connect sources (DB CDC via Debezium, logs) and sinks (object storage, warehouses).
  - Stream processing for light transforms/enrichment; batch systems can replay for heavy transforms.

- Kafka → Snowflake
  - Kafka Connect Snowflake Sink:
    - Option 1: Snowpipe (batch to stage like S3/GCS; Snowpipe ingests; at-least-once with dedupe).
    - Option 2: Snowpipe Streaming (lower latency; improved exactly-once-like guarantees at connector level).
    - Integrate Schema Registry; map keys/headers; configure partitioning, file size/latency thresholds.
  - Alternative: write to cloud storage via S3 sink then Snowpipe ingest.

- Using Airflow to monitor/run Kafka jobs
  - DAGs to deploy/manage Kafka Connect via REST, check task states, and restart failed tasks.
  - Sensors/operators to poll Burrow or Kafka Lag Exporter for lag thresholds; alert on UMs/URPs.
  - Orchestrate topic creation (API/CLI), rolling restarts, checkpoint backups for Streams.

- Exposing Kafka events via a REST API (FastAPI)
  - Produce: endpoints accept requests and publish to Kafka with idempotency keys (use key + headers), return 202/201 after acks=all.
  - Consume: build a dedicated consumer group for the API; serve Server-Sent Events/WebSockets or paginated reads using offsets as cursors.
  - Alternatively use a Kafka REST Proxy; enforce backpressure with rate limits and partition pauses; secure with ACLs and quotas.
