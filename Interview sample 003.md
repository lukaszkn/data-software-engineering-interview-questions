## Here are short, simple answers to each question.

General architecture and data engineering
- Describe an end-to-end data platform you designed.
  I ingest batch and streaming data into a raw storage layer, keep it immutable, and add metadata. Then I clean and standardize it into a conformed layer, and build business-ready models and aggregates for analytics and ML. Orchestration runs in Airflow or Databricks Workflows with monitoring, alerts, and retries. Governance is via Unity Catalog/Purview, with clear access controls and lineage. We publish to BI tools through SQL Warehouses and track cost, freshness, and reliability.

- How do you choose between Data Warehouse, Data Lake, and Lakehouse?
  A warehouse is best for highly structured BI and predictable SQL performance. A lake is flexible and cheap for any data type, but needs extra governance and performance work. A lakehouse (e.g., Delta on Databricks) blends both: open storage, ACID tables, and strong SQL engines, so it’s my default for mixed batch/stream and ML. I choose based on data types, latency needs, team skills, and cost constraints.

- Trade-offs between ELT vs ETL.
  ELT lands data first, then transforms in-platform using scalable compute (Databricks/dbt), which speeds delivery and is easier to change. ETL transforms before loading, which can help with sensitive data, legacy tools, or strict upstream contracts. On modern cloud/lakehouse, ELT is usually faster, cheaper, and more flexible. I use ETL only where regulations or upstream constraints require it.

- How do you ensure scalability, reliability, and cost control?
  I design pipelines to be incremental and idempotent, with checkpoints for recovery. I size clusters appropriately, enable auto-scaling and auto-termination, and optimize tables to avoid small files. I add observability (metrics, logs, data quality checks) and clear alerts with runbooks. I review usage and costs regularly and apply cluster policies and storage lifecycle rules.

- Time you challenged requirements and proposed a better solution.
  A team requested nightly full reloads to “keep it simple.” I proposed CDC-based incremental loads with SLAs and a rollback plan. This cut runtime from hours to minutes, reduced compute costs, and improved data freshness. We also added tests and lineage so stakeholders had more trust in the results.

Databricks and Delta Lakehouse
- Design a Lakehouse with medallion architecture on Azure Databricks.
  I use Auto Loader to ingest files and streaming events into Bronze with minimal transformation. In Silver, I apply cleansing, conform schemas, and de-duplicate; I also attach quality checks. Gold contains business logic, aggregates, and dimensional structures for BI. Unity Catalog manages access and lineage, and Workflows/Airflow orchestrates dependencies. SQL Warehouses serve BI tools; cost and performance are monitored.

- Unity Catalog: key concepts.
  Unity Catalog centralizes governance across workspaces with catalogs, schemas, and tables governed by RBAC. It provides lineage, auditing, data masking, and row/column-level security. It integrates with object storage permissions and simplifies multi-tenant setups. Delta Sharing allows controlled external data sharing without copying data.

- Delta Lake internals: ACID, schema, time travel, CDF.
  Delta uses a transaction log to provide ACID guarantees on files. It enforces and evolves schemas safely, supports time travel for debugging or reproducibility, and offers Change Data Feed for incremental reads. These features make upserts, deletes, and reprocessing reliable at scale. They also simplify backfills and auditing.

- Performance tuning in Databricks.
  I compact small files and set target file sizes, use OPTIMIZE and Z-ORDER on common filters, and choose sensible partition columns. Photon and AQE improve query performance automatically, but I also reduce shuffles and broadcast small joins where possible. I avoid caching large datasets without need and unpersist when done. Regular maintenance like VACUUM keeps storage efficient.

- Jobs vs Workflows vs Delta Live Tables (DLT).
  Workflows coordinate tasks (notebooks, SQL, JARs) with retries and dependencies. DLT is declarative for data pipelines with built-in quality rules, auto-scaling, and lineage. I use DLT for stable, SQL-first pipelines with clear quality gates, and Workflows for more complex or mixed-language orchestration. Jobs API is handy for CI/CD and automation.

- Auto Loader vs classic ingestion.
  Auto Loader incrementally discovers new files, handles schema changes, and deals with small files, which reduces custom code. Classic ingestion often needs manual listing, checkpointing, and file management. For streaming-like file drops and cloud object storage, Auto Loader is my default. I use classic only when the source or protocol dictates it.

- Handling CDC into Delta (e.g., Debezium/Event Hubs).
  I read change records with keys and operation types, then dedupe by key and event time. I use MERGE to apply inserts, updates, and deletes idempotently. Watermarks and ordering avoid double-processing and ensure late data is handled. I monitor error records and push bad events to a DLQ for investigation.

- Cost/performance trade-offs: SQL Warehouse vs clusters; serverless vs classic.
  SQL Warehouses (often serverless) are great for BI concurrency and simple management. All-purpose or job clusters are better for heavy ETL and Python/Scala logic. I use serverless where I need bursty, on-demand scale and easy admin; classic when I need strict control or custom runtimes. Policies, auto-termination, and right-sizing keep costs stable.

PySpark and Spark
- Narrow vs wide transformations.
  Narrow transformations (like map/filter) don’t shuffle data and are cheap. Wide transformations (like groupBy/join) trigger shuffles and are expensive. I minimize wide operations, combine filters early, and pre-aggregate where possible. Understanding this helps me design pipelines that scale.

- Partitioning, repartition/coalesce, skew, joins.
  I pick partition columns with good selectivity and avoid over-partitioning. Repartition reshuffles to balance work; coalesce reduces partitions without shuffle for final writes. For skew, I use salting, AQE skew hints, or broadcast small tables. I choose join strategies based on size and cardinality to reduce shuffles.

- Caching strategies.
  I cache only when a dataset is reused and expensive to recompute. I prefer cache for iterative workloads and development, and I unpersist as soon as it’s not needed. I also watch memory pressure to avoid spilling. Sometimes persisting to disk is safer than caching in memory.

- Window functions and pitfalls.
  Window functions are powerful for rankings and time-based logic. I always define partitions and ordering carefully, and set frames explicitly to avoid unbounded scans. Large or skewed partitions can cause memory issues, so I rebalance or pre-aggregate first. I validate results with small samples before scaling.

- Structured Streaming basics.
  I use micro-batch processing with checkpoints for reliability. For stateful operations, I define watermarks to limit state and handle late events. Exactly-once is approximated with idempotent sinks (Delta MERGE) and careful keying. I monitor throughput, latency, and consumer lag.

- Checkpointing, idempotency, replay.
  I checkpoint both offsets and state so jobs can recover after failures. Writes are idempotent using deterministic keys and MERGE semantics. For reprocessing, I either reset checkpoints carefully or backfill through batch paths. I document replay procedures to avoid duplicates.

- Testing PySpark code.
  I write unit tests with pytest and a local Spark session, and use chispa for DataFrame equality. I mock sources/sinks and test edge cases like nulls and out-of-order events. For integration, I run small jobs in a dev cluster and validate schema, partitioning, and performance. CI runs tests on every PR.

SQL
- Write/optimize a complex query.
  I start with clear CTEs and filter early to reduce data volume. I use appropriate join types and keys, and avoid SELECT * in production. I check the query plan for shuffles and broadcast opportunities. If needed, I pre-aggregate or materialize intermediate results to Delta for reuse.

- Common SQL-on-lake performance issues.
  Problems often come from too many small files, poor partitioning, or skewed joins. Lack of statistics and overuse of DISTINCT or window functions can also hurt. I use OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER, partition pruning, and collect stats where available. I inspect query profiles and fix the biggest bottlenecks first.

- Designing incremental models (late data, SCD).
  I track a high-water mark based on updated_at or ingestion time. I use MERGE for upserts and manage deletes explicitly. For SCD Type 2, I maintain effective_from/effective_to and is_current flags. I design for late-arriving updates by re-opening affected windows.

Streaming: Kafka and Flink (and Spark)
- Build a robust streaming pipeline from Kafka to Delta.
  I define stable topic schemas and keys, and use Schema Registry. I read with Structured Streaming or Flink, validate and dedupe, and write to Delta with checkpoints. I monitor consumer lag and throughput, and scale partitions or consumers as needed. DLQ captures bad messages for later fixes.

- Topic modeling and schema evolution.
  Keep one logical event type per topic, key by entity ID, and size partitions for expected throughput. Use backward-compatible schema changes and evolve carefully. Enforce schema at read time and reject or route incompatible records. Document contracts so producers and consumers stay aligned.

- Exactly-once processing end to end.
  I combine checkpointed reads with idempotent, transactional writes (Delta MERGE). I use deterministic keys and dedupe logic to avoid duplicates. Where needed, two-phase commit patterns or transactional sinks help. I test failure scenarios to confirm behavior.

- Spark Structured Streaming vs Flink.
  Spark is strong for unified batch and streaming on Databricks, with easy integration to Delta and ML. Flink shines for very low latency, complex event time processing, and custom state management. I choose Spark for most lakehouse use cases; Flink when sub-second latency or advanced CEP is a must. Sometimes both coexist.

Orchestration and transformation: Airflow, dbt, Fabric Data Factory
- Airflow DAG design best practices.
  Make tasks idempotent, parameterized, and small. Add retries, SLAs, and alerts; avoid long-running sensors by using event-driven triggers. Support backfills and clear dependency graphs. Use secrets safely and keep business logic in code or SQL files, not operators.

- Structuring dbt projects for a Lakehouse.
  I split models into staging, intermediate, and marts, and use incremental materializations with unique keys. I rely on dbt tests (unique, not_null, relationships) and document exposures. Macros standardize patterns and reduce duplication. CI runs dbt build to validate changes before deploy.

- dbt on Databricks.
  I use the Databricks adapter with Delta materializations for incremental models. Permissions go through Unity Catalog, and I align schemas with catalogs/workspaces. I integrate dbt with GitHub Actions or dbt Cloud for CI and deployment. I monitor performance via Databricks SQL query history.

- When to use ADF/Fabric Data Factory vs Airflow/Workflows.
  ADF/Fabric is great for managed data movement, copy activities, and Azure-native integrations. Airflow/Workflows is better for complex dependencies, branching, and code-heavy tasks. Often I mix them: ADF copies or triggers, while Airflow coordinates end-to-end logic. Choice depends on team skills and ops model.

- Dependency management and data contracts across pipelines.
  I define schemas, SLAs, and ownership, and version changes in a registry or docs. I make changes additive first (new columns) and deprecate later. Contract tests and schema checks run in CI and in production jobs. Consumers get advance notice and a migration plan.

Cloud (Azure focus)
- ADLS Gen2 and access.
  I prefer ABFS URIs with hierarchical namespace and Unity Catalog governance. Managed identities grant storage access, reducing secrets. I use ACLs and RBAC consistently and avoid mounts where possible for better control. I tag and organize storage paths by domain and environment.

- Managed identities vs service principals.
  Managed identities are simpler and more secure because there are no secrets to rotate. When I must use service principals, I store secrets in Key Vault and rotate them. I limit permissions to least privilege and audit usage. This reduces risks and admin overhead.

- Networking.
  I use private endpoints, VNet injection, and NSGs to keep data traffic private. I disable public access and control egress paths. I also segment environments (dev/test/prod) and apply firewall rules consistently. This setup supports compliance and lowers exposure.

- Cost controls for Databricks and storage.
  I enable auto-termination, right-size clusters, and use spot where appropriate. I prevent small files with proper batch sizes and run OPTIMIZE. Storage lifecycle policies move cold data to cheaper tiers. Dashboards track spend per workspace, cluster, and job.

Data modeling and architecture patterns
- Data Vault 2.0 vs dimensional modeling.
  Data Vault is great for integrating changing sources with strong auditability, but it’s verbose and can be slower for analytics. Dimensional modeling is simpler for BI and faster to query. I sometimes land in Data Vault (or a conformed Silver) and publish dimensional models to Gold. The choice depends on stability of sources and consumption needs.

- Medallion architecture best practices.
  Bronze is raw and append-only; keep lineage and don’t apply business logic there. Silver standardizes, cleans, and unifies entities, with strong quality checks. Gold applies business rules, aggregates, and serving models for specific use cases. Keep transformations incremental and well-documented.

- Data Mesh: when and how.
  Use Data Mesh when domains can own their data products with clear contracts and teams. Provide a central platform (governance, tooling, security) to avoid fragmentation. Start with a few domains, define standards, and measure adoption and quality. Without governance and enablement, Mesh can become chaos.

- Lambda vs Kappa architectures.
  Lambda uses batch and streaming paths for the same logic, which helps with backfills but doubles code. Kappa uses a single streaming path and replays events for backfills, which simplifies maintenance. I choose Lambda when batch backfills are heavy and necessary; Kappa when event streams are the source of truth. Both need good replay strategies.

- Multi-tenant or multi-domain design.
  I separate catalogs/schemas by domain and environment, apply RBAC/row-level security, and tag data for ownership and cost. I standardize data contracts so teams can interoperate. I isolate noisy workloads and sensitive data. This keeps platforms safe and manageable.

Data governance and quality
- Implementing data quality checks.
  I add checks at each layer: schema, nulls, ranges, referential integrity, and duplicates. I use tools like dbt tests or Great Expectations and fail fast on critical rules. Results go to dashboards with alerts for regressions. I also track test coverage and remediate recurring issues.

- Handling PII (GDPR, etc.).
  I minimize collection, encrypt at rest and in transit, and mask or tokenize where needed. Access uses least privilege and audit logs. I support data subject requests (e.g., right to be forgotten) with clear data maps and deletion routines. Policies are documented and automated where possible.

- Lineage and metadata.
  I capture lineage with Unity Catalog and, where useful, Purview/OpenLineage. I auto-collect where possible and keep docs close to code. Lineage helps with impact analysis, audits, and incident response. It also improves trust with stakeholders.

- Access control models.
  I use RBAC groups for coarse permissions and row/column-level policies for sensitive data. Attributes and tags can drive ABAC where supported. I review access regularly and automate provisioning. Temporary access is time-bound and audited.

- Data retention and archival.
  I define retention by data class and legal needs, and automate deletes. I use VACUUM carefully to manage old files and time travel windows. Cold data moves to cheaper storage tiers. Policies are documented and monitored.

DevOps, Git, and CI/CD
- Branching strategies.
  I prefer trunk-based development with small, frequent PRs and protected main. Feature flags and good tests allow safe merges. Code owners and templates keep quality consistent. This keeps delivery fast and stable.

- CI/CD for Databricks/dbt/Airflow.
  CI runs unit tests, linters, and dbt tests on every PR. CD promotes code and configs through dev/test/prod with approvals. I validate migrations, run smoke tests, and roll back safely if needed. Infra changes go through the same pipeline.

- Infrastructure as Code.
  I manage Databricks workspaces, clusters, UC objects, and Azure resources with Terraform. Plans are reviewed, and policies enforce standards. This prevents drift and speeds repeatable setups. It also improves compliance.

- Packaging Python for Databricks.
  I build wheels with pinned dependencies and test against the target runtime. I publish to a package repo or use UC volumes, and manage versions clearly. This keeps environments reproducible and reduces “works on my machine” issues. I also cache environments where possible.

- Blue/green or canary releases for data.
  I write to shadow tables, compare metrics, and switch consumers after validation. Additive schema changes go first; breaking changes come with migration plans. Canary a subset of data or users to reduce risk. Rollback is simple and documented.

Performance, reliability, and cost optimization
- Troubleshooting slow Spark jobs.
  I inspect Spark UI for skewed stages, large shuffles, and long tasks. I reduce shuffles, broadcast small joins, and adjust partitioning. I fix small-file issues and filter early to shrink data. Then I retest and monitor to confirm improvements.

- Handling data skew and small files.
  For skew, I use salting, skew hints, or pre-aggregation; for small files, I adjust batch sizes and run OPTIMIZE. Auto Loader helps reduce small files on ingest. I also tune target file sizes and use Z-ORDER. Regular maintenance keeps performance stable.

- Optimizing storage layout and table design.
  I pick partition columns that match common filters and avoid too many partitions. I target ~100–500 MB files and use clustering (Z-ORDER) for secondary filters. I separate hot vs cold data and use CDF for increments. The goal is fast reads and manageable costs.

- Ensuring SLAs and reliability.
  I define clear SLAs and SLOs, add alerts, and create on-call runbooks. Pipelines are idempotent with retries and circuit breakers. I track freshness, error rates, and usage. Post-incident reviews lead to permanent fixes.

Security
- Secrets and certificate management.
  I store secrets in Key Vault or Databricks secrets and never hardcode them. I rotate regularly and prefer managed identities to avoid secrets at all. Certificates are managed centrally with clear expiry alerts. Access is audited.

- Network isolation and least privilege.
  I keep traffic private with VNet injection and private endpoints, and block public access. I grant only the permissions required for each role or service. Regular reviews remove unused access. This reduces attack surface and helps compliance.

- Auditing and anomaly detection.
  I enable audit logs in Unity Catalog and cloud services and centralize them. I set alerts for unusual access or data exfiltration patterns. Regular reviews and playbooks guide response. Findings feed into policy and training updates.

Testing and documentation
- What to test and how.
  I unit test transformations, contract test schemas, and data test quality rules. Integration tests validate end-to-end with small datasets. CI runs tests on every change, and scheduled validations run in production. Failures alert the team with context.

- Test data management.
  I use synthetic data for units and masked subsets for integration. I include edge cases like nulls, duplicates, and late events. I version datasets and keep them small for fast feedback. This keeps tests realistic without exposing sensitive data.

- Documentation approach.
  I keep docs close to code (READMEs, comments, dbt docs) and auto-generate lineage. I document contracts, SLAs, and ownership. PR templates remind us to update docs. This helps onboarding and reduces misunderstandings.

Mentoring, leadership, and collaboration
- Mentoring examples.
  I pair-program on complex tasks, run short knowledge sessions, and share templates and checklists. I focus on repeatable patterns, testing culture, and clear standards. I encourage questions and celebrate improvements. The goal is to make the team faster and more confident.

- Running code reviews.
  I check correctness, readability, performance, and security, and I expect tests and docs. Feedback is respectful and specific, with examples or snippets. I keep PRs small and encourage follow-ups for larger refactors. Reviews are a learning tool, not a gatekeeping exercise.

- Working with product/business.
  I start with the problem, success metrics, and constraints. I propose options with trade-offs and recommend the simplest plan that meets the goal. I deliver an MVP quickly and iterate based on feedback. Transparency builds trust and avoids rework.

- Handling cross-team dependencies.
  I set clear data contracts, owners, and SLAs, and schedule regular syncs. I raise risks early and document interfaces and changes. I use tickets and dashboards to keep everyone aligned. This reduces surprises and delays.

Behavioral and scenario-based
- Failed pipeline incident and remediation.
  A schema change broke a critical job overnight. We restored from time travel, added schema checks, and created a DLQ to isolate bad records. We improved alerts and added a contract with the source team. The incident did not repeat.

- Migration to cloud/Databricks lessons.
  Start with a secure landing zone and standards for naming, networking, and governance. Pilot with a few pipelines and measure cost and performance early. Invest in developer workflows (CI/CD, IaC, notebooks standards). Communicate wins and lessons to drive adoption.

- Balancing speed vs quality.
  I ship a safe MVP with basic tests, observability, and rollback. I plan follow-up hardening work and communicate trade-offs and timelines. I avoid shortcuts that create long-term risk, like skipping data contracts. This balances delivery speed and reliability.

- Introducing a new standard/practice.
  I pilot with one team, measure outcomes (time saved, fewer bugs), and simplify docs. I provide templates and office hours for support. Early adopters act as champions. Adoption grows through proof, not mandates.

Hands-on/case prompts
- Whiteboard an Azure Databricks Lakehouse.
  Event Hubs/Kafka and CDC feed Bronze via Auto Loader/connectors; Silver cleans and conforms; Gold exposes marts and feature tables. Unity Catalog governs access and lineage. Airflow/Workflows orchestrate; dbt builds SQL models. Private networking, quality checks at each hop, and cost dashboards complete the setup.

- PySpark upsert CDC into Delta.
  Read CDC, standardize ops, and dedupe by key and timestamp. Use MERGE to apply inserts/updates/deletes idempotently. Checkpoint progress and add unit tests for merge logic and late records. Partition outputs sensibly and run OPTIMIZE.

- Optimize a slow Spark job.
  Inspect Spark UI, identify skewed joins and large shuffles, and reduce them with broadcast or salting. Filter and pre-aggregate early, fix small-file issues, and adjust partitions. Enable AQE and use Photon. Re-run and compare stage times to confirm gains.

- dbt incremental SCD model.
  Use incremental materialization with unique_key and is_incremental filters. Implement SCD Type 2 with effective_from/effective_to and is_current. Add tests for uniqueness and referential integrity. Document contract and add exposures for BI.

- Streaming with exactly-once semantics.
  Key events, add watermarks, and use stateful ops as needed. Write to Delta with MERGE and checkpointed offsets for idempotency. DLQ bad events and monitor lag and throughput. Test failure scenarios and reprocessing procedures.

Role/company fit and communication
- Approach to the “why” behind requirements.
  I ask what decision the data will drive, how fresh it must be, and what “good” looks like. Then I propose options with trade-offs in cost, complexity, and time. We agree on a smallest-valuable solution and milestones. This keeps scope focused and value clear.

- Measuring value delivered.
  I track freshness, reliability, cost per pipeline, and usage by consumers. I also tie outcomes to business metrics like faster reporting, fewer incidents, or revenue/cost impact. A simple scorecard shows trends over time. This helps prioritize and justify investments.

- Working across multiple clients/domains.
  I bring a standard toolkit (templates, IaC, governance patterns) and run a short discovery to map domain specifics. I reuse proven patterns but avoid over-customizing unless needed. I document decisions and share knowledge to speed onboarding. This keeps delivery fast and consistent.
